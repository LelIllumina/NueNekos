> Basically none of anything I like is objectively good to me. I don't have any in-depth analysis on any of the shows I like; everything I like is purely based on the rating of enjoyment I happened to have and how much I liked investing time in the franchise.

## Kara No Kyoukai
The absolute GOAT anime movie series, I started watching this after watching all of Fate/Stay Night and binged it all night (Not all in one day though if I remember correctly). The theme and aesthetics were quite cool and I liked the music a lot. Story wise whatever I found fascinating I dont remember anymore as I watched it as a, I think 13 or 14 year old and my stupid brain couldnt be bothered to remember all that.  
Out of the very few movie series I've watched its my favorite. Also I want shiki to tease slicing me apart with her fingers while taking breaks to eat that Häagen-Dazs®.

## Panty & Stocking with Garterbelt
The only show I liked watching the dub of. Some people might disagree with that because of how corny the dub might sound but honetly I don't think it would've hit the same if it wasn't for the unfiltered dub script nutting into my ears. I found it pretty funny and the artstlye reminded me of Cartoon Netowrk untill they started transforming and looked hot. Waiting on the sequel that releases, i believe, next month from writing this. Prolly the funniest in this sort of humour.

## Fate/Stay Night Heaven's feel
On my "plan to rewatch" list alongside KnK, which I mentioned above. Fate was one of those anime I liked as soon as I started watching. I'm pretty sure I watched it before any of the other anime on this list (other than F/Z, I'm sorry I started with F/Z)
Heaven's feel is probably my favorite for these reasons
    - Sakura
    - The animation, I love you Ufotable
    - The different theme from the other 2 routes
    - Sakura
    - More Medusa
    - Shinji dying
    - The Emiyas

## Fate/Zero
The prequel that was better. Well, it was a slightly different theme from F/SN but it pulled it off pretty well I'd say. There used to be a youtube comment I liked a lot before I started thinking it was corny that read: "somthing something The Anti-Christ vs John Wick something something" on a now taken down video.

## Steins;Gate

## Eighty Six

## CodeGeass

## Toaru Franchise
