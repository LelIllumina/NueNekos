> Basically none of anything I like is objectively good to me. I don't have any in-depth analysis on any of the shows I like; everything I like is purely based on the rating of enjoyment I happened to have and how much I liked investing time in the franchise.

## Kara No Kyoukai
The absolute GOAT anime movie series. I started watching this after watching all of Fate/Stay Night and binged it all night (not all in one day, though, if I remember correctly). The theme and aesthetics were quite cool and I liked the music a lot. Story wise, whatever I found fascinating, I don't remember anymore as I watched it as a 13 or 14 year old and my stupid brain couldn't be bothered to remember all that.  
Out of the very few movie series I've watched, it's my favorite. Also, I want shiki to tease, slicing me apart with her fingers while taking breaks to eat that Häagen-Dazs®.

## Panty & Stocking with Garterbelt
The only show I liked watching the dub of. Some people might disagree with that because of how corny the dub might sound, but honestly, I don't think it would've hit the same if it wasn't for the unfiltered dub script nutting into my ears. I found it pretty funny, and the art style reminded me of Cartoon Network until they started transforming and looked hot. Waiting on the sequel that releases, I believe, next month from writing this. Probably the funniest in this sort of humor.

## Fate/Stay Night Heaven's feel
On my “plan to rewatch” list alongside KnK, which I mentioned above. Fate was one of those anime I liked as soon as I started watching. I'm pretty sure I watched it before any of the other anime on this list (other than F/Z, I'm sorry I started with F/Z)
Heaven's Feel is probably my favorite for these reasons:
- Sakura
- The animation, I love you Ufotable
- The different theme from the other 2 routes
- Sakura
- More Medusa
- Shinji dying
- The Emiyas

## Fate/Zero
The prequel that was better. Well, it was a slightly different theme from F/SN, but it pulled it off pretty well, I'd say. There used to be a YouTube comment I liked a lot before I started thinking it was corny that read: “something something The Anti-Christ VS John Wick something something” on a now taken down video. Even though people say to watch this after F/SN, I quite enjoyed starting off with this.
It's one of the few Anime I have re-watched. Both Kirei and Kiritsugu are out of my favorite characters and Saber on a motorbike and Iris driving is fire.

## Steins;Gate
I haven't watched that many Time-Travel Anime, only other one that comes to mind is Erased, and others where time travel is just a subplot. But still, Steins;Gate would have to be the best one. As with many of the other anime here, I watched it quite a while ago and don't remember much. BUT I do remember being quite baffled with how the story is knitted together to keep some suspense and link events together at the same time.

You might have noticed by now that most of the anime I like are the introductory anime for me in their respective genre/theme. 

## Eighty Six
I might just love Lena a lot because I don't remember why I liked this anime so much. I remember feeling pretty thrilled watching through it, more so than other good anime I enjoyed. However, not particularly why I enjoyed it. I very faintly remember the plot—something about some army squad No. 86 going after *some* threat. But more so, what I remember is Lena's thighs.

## CodeGeass
This is one of the more recent favorite animes, and as such I remember more than just its name. R2 and ressurection are probably my favorite in the franchise but I watched them at the opposite ends of my watch through timeline. I started out with the anime (Lelouch of the Rebellion) of course and than S2/R2 but I didn't watch the recap movies or "Lelouch of the Re;surrection" yet. After R2 I watched "Akito the Exileds", it didnt have the same charm as the anime and neither did the "Rozé of the Recapture", Rozé and Catherine were hot though so it's fine I guess. After watching those I decided to watch the recap films, kinda sucked but Re;surrection made up for that.

## Toaru Franchise
I enjoyed watching Index when I just found it by chance, but I really got into the franchise after I found out one of my friends was really into it. Technically, I haven't watched as much of the anime as I've read all the manga spin-offs. I decided not to add Toaru on the manga page because of duplication, but I haven't watched the “The Miracle of Endymion” movie, the Accelerator anime, or probably quite a few OVAs, but I braved through J.C staffs butchering of the index and Railgun seasons. I'll mention the manga I've read here because I probably won't on the manga page.  

I've read Railgun, Index, Mental Out, Astral Buddy, Idol Accelerator, Endymion, Dark Matter, ITEM, Toaru Majutsu no Heavy na Zashiki Warashi ga Kantan na Satsujinki no Konkatsu Jijou and probably a few others, not caught up on all but still.

## Honorable Mentions
- Madoka Magica
- Re;Zero
- Evangelion
- Koe No Katachi
- All the TRIGGER Anime I've watched
- All the KyoAni Anime I've watched
