## Hirasawr
Susumu Hirasawa is probably the only artist I have listened to the whole discography of, or atleast almost all of it, theres a few game osts I never bothered listening to :p However, many of his other albums I have listened through many times, including the Kaku P-Model ones. I do have to listen through the P-Model albums though. I've definately listened to both the Mandrake Unreleased Materials vols.
